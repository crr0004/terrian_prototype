Update & Draw cycle for polygons:

Invariants:
- The draw call needs a modelview matrix to be the combined the polygon and the camera
- The update call must set modelview matrix and the polygon to be combined
- The update call has to happen before the draw call

Two ways:
1.
Call updates on all objects
Call draw on all objects
2. - Do this for now
Call update on objects
Call draw on objects

Implications:
1.
Must have stack size for all copies of the modelview matrix
Draws must happen in reverse order
